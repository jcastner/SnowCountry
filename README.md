An app with the ability to track, monitor, and plan ski/snowboard/cross country runs and interact with friends

## Changes from ARCGIS-Test repo (11/11)

- Reorganized file structure
- Removed unneeded packages
- Reworked user sign in and login flow to use async calls and upload the user to firestore for further functionality
- Added simple way of interacting with the user across views
- Added functionality to the edit profile section so the user can change their username and profile picture

## Major things that still need to happen
- Track run functionality
- Create/draw run functionality
- Come up a data model to save runs (and interact with them on social)
- Add friends functionality
- Create/edit posts functionality
